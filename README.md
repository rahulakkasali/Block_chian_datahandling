## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **blockchain-inspired, decentralized data sharing system** where users can securely share files (photos, videos, documents) **without using a central server or database**.

Instead of storing data on the blockchain, the system:
- Stores **encrypted files off-chain**
- Uses a **blockchain ledger only for permissions, ownership, and integrity**
- Allows **only authorized users** to access shared data

👉 This project focuses on **blockchain as a technology**, not cryptocurrency or payments.

## 🧠 Core Idea

> **Blockchain controls trust and permissions.  
Encrypted storage holds the actual data.  
Keys decide access.**
